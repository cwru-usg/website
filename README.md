Website
=======
*The Undergraduate Student Government* of *Case Western Reserve University*

In response to a terrible website based on Drupal, members of the Undergraduate Student 
Government set out to recreate the website in 2012.  They explored a number of ready-made 
options like content management systems or blogs, but none offered the level of 
flexibility for creating customized content while preventing a typical user from 
controlling the way information is presented.  This is the result of ultimately ceding to 
the idea of rolling our own.

Built on Rails
--------------
This site is built upon the Ruby on Rails framework.  If you don't know what that means, 
go do some Googling and swing back by.
